# Text Editor PWA

## Description

This is a simple text editor app, which has been upgraded to a Progressive Web App (PWA). As a PWA is can be downloaded to operate in the browser offline - so you can keep using the app, even when you lose your internet connection. Then, once your connection is restored, the changes you made will be synced to the database and saved on the remote server.
